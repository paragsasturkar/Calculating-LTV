LTV: The LTV is a metric used to value customers that a business acquires. It is a fundamental KPI that is used to analyze the health of our business's marketing efforts. In SaaS and online retail, investors and operators will often compare the LTV to the cost to acquire a customer (CAC) as a way to measure the ROI of advertising spend.

At a high level, the lifetime value of a customer is equivalent to the purchases a customer makes over a given timeline. The LTV should always be defined by a particular time horizon (e.g., 6 month, 12 month, 24 month) so it can be compared (apples to apples) to other businesses. The LTV of a cohort of customers is calculated by grouping customers into a cohort, and then tracking their purchases over time.


The Exercise:

See the attached data file.

- this is order data from 2/1/2015 through 3/30/2016 (approximately 14 months)

- note that the data here has been manipulated slightly for obvious security reasons

- you can assume that all purchasers in month 1 of the data set (2/2015) are new customers



I have attached an example of the chart we would like you to create. Please create a similar chart for the LTV of the February cohort. You can use all the data in the data set (so 2/1/2015 through 3/30/2016 - 13 month time horizon after the end of 2/2015).

- the cohort LTV is segmented by customer type

- % of customers is the % of all customers in the cohort that are the customer type

- % of Rev is the % of gross revenue of the entire cohort (only the cohort's revenue) over the entire time horizon

- LTV (GMV) is the average LTV of the customer type

Very important!! The LTV should be calculated for only one cohort of customers (in this case February) over a specific timeline. Some people fall into the "trap", where they take a dataset of customers (say 12 months of data), find the number of customers, sum of purchases per customers, etc, and present it in the format below. This is flawed because the customers in the later months in that data set do not have a chance to repurchase. Therefore, you always need to think of LTV (and calculate it) over a specific time horizon and track the purchases of a particular group of customers over time.
